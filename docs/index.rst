===========================================
Happy!  A Web Application Component Library
===========================================

Happy is a web application library providing components for common tasks when
composing web applications or web application frameworks.  Happy is an
experiment in decomposition, providing much of the same functionality you would
find in an integrated framework, but does not force developers to buy into a
world view just to use one component.  Happy components are not intended to
be a framework but can be used to compose frameworks or applications.  The goal
of Happy is as much about suggesting patterns for developing web application
components as it is about providing a specific set of components.

Happy uses the :term:`WSGI` protocol and are therefore compatible, at a low
level, with other :term:`WSGI` frameworks and applications.  Happy is happy to
hop on the bandwagon of using :term:`WebOb` to hide the bare :term:`WSGI`, a
convention which is quickly becoming the de facto standard.

XXX Discuss trade offs between framework and library approach.  No approach
is superior in all cases.

Happy has 100% unit test coverage.  No component is considered releasable
unless it has been documented.
